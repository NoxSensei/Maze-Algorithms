                    The goal of the given project is practicing the maze generation algorithms. Inspired by the
                    book &quot;Mazes for Programmers&quot; by Jamis Buck, I have decided to implement my own
                    solution with Next.js. Given idea allowed me to get familiar with the basic maze generation
                    concepts and represent their generation process on the canvas. Additionally I was able to prepare
                    detailed descriptions, flow charts and animations making it easier to understand their rules.

                <p className="pb-[5%] text-justify">
                    In my implementation I have been using approach where the grid is already generated and algorithm
                    is building passages by destroying the walls. If you got a moment take a look into the useful
                    links section as part of the algorithms starts with all walls placed, some of them with empty grid
                    and
                    there are ones that can work in two modes. There are also other cool classifications worth seeing.
